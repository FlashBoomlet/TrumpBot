wall~"I am going to build a wall. The wall is going to be huge. The wall is located at the southern united states boarder. Walls and the wall provide security. Security is important to enforce with a wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Ten feet higher. Height of the wall is tall. The wall can be payed for. The wall is not expensive. The wall is long, several thousand or hundred miles. Mexico will pay for the wall one way or another. Illegal immigrants from mexico are hurting our economy. We need to build that wall."
terrorism~"Terrosists live in mosques. Syria, iran, and Lybia are home to ISIS and the islamic state terrorists. Jihad is terrible. Muslims are terrorists. Muslims are dangerous. Every day we face islamic terrorism. Terrorists around the world are dangerous to America, the United States, and the American way of life. Terrorists kill innocent people. Terrorism is bad. We hate terrorists. Radical Islam is terrorism."
china~"China is killing us in trade. China is bad for our economy. China has workers taking our jobs. Ships come from china full of goods and go back empty. We need to make better trade deals with China. We need to negotiate with china. What china is doing with the southeastern asia sea is not allowed. They are taking over."
taxes~"The middle class will get more tax breaks. Small businesses will get more tax breaks. Cut business rate to 15 percent. Reduce individual rates to three brackets of 12, 25, and 33 percent, with a 0 percent rate for many. Add above-the-line deduction for childcare costs, including for stay at home parents. Eliminate job killing regulations. I try and pay as little tax as possible, because I hate what they do with my tax money. I hate the way they spend our money. I know people making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no taxes, and I think it's unfair. I'm not talking about a tax increase. I'm talking about a tremendous tax decrease. Proposals always change in negotiations with Congress but I am committed to cutting taxes."
children~"The biggest benefit to working- and middle-class families. This plan is needed because child care expenses are one of the largest expenses in many families, complicating a family's decision on how to care for young children. The Trump reforms will allow a family to make the choice of whether a parent should work outside the home or not without bias from the tax code. Having employed and empowered thousands of women at every level throughout his entire career, Donald Trump understands the needs of the modern workforce. Add incentives for employers to provide child care at the workplace. The Trump plan will guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the existing unemployment insurance that companies are required to carry. The benefit would apply only when employers don't offer paid maternity leave"
immigration~"Restore integrity to our immigration system by prioritizing the interests of Americans first. Enforce our immigration laws – at the border and at the workplace. Build a border wall and end sanctuary cities. Send criminal aliens home. Welcome those who embrace our way of life, but keep out immigrants and refugees who don’t through rigorous vetting. We vet our immigrants. They come to our country legally. They lower minimum wage. The immigrants coming here are the worst. Crime rates and criminals come from Immigrants. Immigrant people should assimilate. We love those who embrace our culture. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists. We want people to come legally. Legally."
trade~"Everyone all across the globe and the world is killing us in trade. We need to enact better trade policies with Mexico, China, Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Experience with making deals with other countries is important to trade. Trading is good. Our country has the best products. Stealing jobs. Other countries are beating us. We make terrible trade deals. NAFTA and TPP are the worst trade deals ever made."
police~"Without the police we wouldn't have a country. Police protect us every day. Police don't deserve enough respect. The police are the most mistreated people in america. Police can't do their job because of political correctness. Sheriff David Clarke is a good role model."
guns~"We need to protect our second amendment. We need to protect our 2nd amendment. It is our constitutional right to own guns. Guns and firearms help us protect ourselves, our families, and other. Guns are good. Recall the guns is bad. Unwavering support of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Get serious about prosecuting violent criminals. Get gang members and drug dealers off the street to make our cities and communities safer. Empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves. Expand mental health programs keep the violent mentally ill off of our streets. “Democrats want to confiscate all guns, which is a dumb idea because only the law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns and the bad guys would be the only ones left armed."
education~"Every child in America deserves a great education and an opportunity to achieve their dreams. We will enhance education options for students through school choice and charters, and respect home schoolers in their quest for educational alternatives. We will also make it easier for families to afford college so students aren’t buried in debt. I'm a tremendous believer in education, but education has to be at a local level. We cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child's education. They're in college. They're doing well but they've got student loans up to the neck. They're swimming in these loans. I'm not concerned about the kids growing up in wealthy communities, where high property taxes have allowed them to build great schools, hire the best teachers, and provide all the supplies they need. Those schools are doing fine. Let parents choose the school their children grow up in."
jobs~"We're going to eliminate job-killing regulations. We're going to bring businesses back. We're going to have businesses that are now in Mexico come back to New Hampshire and you can tell them to go fuck themselves. We will have all of the jobs. Jobs are importants and jobs are for americans. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. Overseas workers are taking our jobs. Coal miners are the heart of america, they need jobs. Americans just want a job. Factories are getting sent overseas to other countries. We need factories here to have good jobs. Middle class people need good jobs."
ivanka~"My daughter Ivanka is a wonderful woman. My daughter is also a mother. She is strong and a woman who has leadership roles. She is an example of equality between genders. Ivanka is the best woman ever."
melania~"My wife melania will be a great first lady. Melania is an immigrant but the best immigrant. Melania is an intelligent model. She is a wife to Donald Trump."
eric~"Eric Trump is the son of Donald Trump. Eric Trump is successful."
jr~"Favorite child of all of Donald Trump's children. Donald Trump Jr. is the son of Donald Trump. He is active in Donald Trump's campaign and has been helping out. He is family."
character~"Donald Trump is a successful business man. He has accomplished a lot in his life time in real estate. He has properties in new york, golf courses, and hotels around the world. Donald trump is a billionaire. Donald Trump is committed to making america great again. He is determined and has the temperament and judgement to be president. He is hard working loves everyone. Everyone loves Donald Trump too."
clinton~"Everybody hates Hillary Clinton. Clinton is crooked. Clinton is a liar. Benghazi, the clinton foundation, the DNC, bill clinton, the democratic party, Obama, secretary of state, and the Iran deal are all examples of her poor judgement and terrible track record. Hillary clinton is bad. No one likes hillary clinton because she is sick. Clinton is sick and has an illness or is ill. FBI investigations don't end the conversation either. She was hacked by russia and the ukraine. She is hacked by everyone. She is responsible for people dying. Get money out of the white house. Paid politicians. Get money out of politics."
abortion~"Planned parenthood is bad. Pro life versus pro choice. Pro-life versus pro-choice. Pregnancy and late abortions."
healthcare~"Obamacare is a disaster of a healthcare plan. We need to repeal and replace obamacare. Obama care is bad. Pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs need to have restrictions freed. We need health insurance between states. Health care costs are bad."
foreignpolicy~"We need a strong military. We can't keep taking care of the entire world. Globalism is bad. Foreign policy needs to be good. Iran was bad. ISIS was bad. Benghazi. Globalization is bad. Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, Germany, Mexico, and China are using us and are bad. Strong borders and good diplomacy with other nations and nation states is important. We need to be tough on our enemies and loyal to our allies."
